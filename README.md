# CitiBike Analysis

## Overview
This analysis was created to convince investors that a bike-sharing program in Des Moines will be a worthwhile investment. To convince them, I created a  bike trip analysis and created visualizations that would show the length of time that bikes are checked out for all riders and genders,  the number of bike trips by genders for each hour of each day of the week,  the number of bike trips for each type of user and gender for each day of the week. This analysis also includes the most popular start and end locations.

## Results:

This visualization describes the number of bikes per hour of trip duration, showing the number of bikers after 0, 1, 2, and 3 hours. From the graph, it is clear that there are a much larger number of bikers at longer trip durations, with the number still increasing at three hours.

This visualization describes the number of bikes per hour of trip duration, showing the number of bikers after 0, 1, and 2 hours. This is the same as the last visualization except for the added component of breaking down trip duration by gender. There is a much higher number of female bikers at a long trip duration. This number increases greatly after one hour.

This visualization describes the duration of bikers trip based on their stop time for each hour of the day and for seven days a week. The longest trip durations stop times are concentrated at 5 or 6 pm on Monday and Tuesdays, with Thursdays from 5-6 being the largest number of bikers.

The next visualization shows the number of bike trips by gender for each day of the week and for each hour. It shows a higher concentration from 5-6 PM Monday, Tuesday, and Thursday especially for women but a much less clear pattern for men.

This visualization shows the number of bike trips by gender for each day of the week and for each hour, and adds in the additional component of usertype.  It shows the same pattern pf a higher concentration from 5-6 PM Monday, Tuesday, and Thursday especially for women who are subscribers. Those who are customers show much less of a pattern, which would be because they use the bikes more randomly.

This next visualization shows the concentration of bikers from different start trip locations, which gives valuable information as to where most trips begin. From this visualization, we can see that trips are highly concentrated in one part of the city, which could be an indication that concentrating bike shares in smaller areas is more effective than having them equally dispersed in the city.

This visualization shows the concentration of bikers from different end trip locations. The end trips seem to be slightly more dispersed then the starting locations, so it could be useful to ensure there are bike share stations in less centralized areas to ensure customers have a place to drop off their bikes.

## Summary
For additional analysis, one other data visualization that could be included would be finding the trip duration by trip origin. Another visualization that could be included would be an analysis of what the start location and end location is based on gender.
