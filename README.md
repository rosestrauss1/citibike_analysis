# CitiBike Analysis

## Overview
This analysis was created to convince investors that a bike-sharing program in Des Moines will be a worthwhile investment. To convince them, I created a  bike trip analysis and created visualizations that would show the length of time that bikes are checked out for all riders and genders,  the number of bike trips by genders for each hour of each day of the week,  the number of bike trips for each type of user and gender for each day of the week. This analysis also includes the most popular start and end locations.

## Results:

## Summary
For additional analysis, one other data visualization that could be included would be finding the trip duration by trip origin. Another visualization that could be included would be an analysis of what the start location and end location is based on gender.
